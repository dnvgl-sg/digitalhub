### Smart Lift

Digital Solutions Development team has implemented a smart building management system. The key technology of the project is deployment of IoT sensors on the lift and gather the data from it in real time. The data is analyzed to predict the lift failure and optimize the maintenance. 

You can see some parts of digitalized dashboard and a conceptual digital twin technology with automatic alarming for maintenance. You can see the simulated 13 elevators in 3D in below link and it is synchronized with the dashboard in real time.

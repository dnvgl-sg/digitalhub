# Data Ecosystem
Data is becoming the new raw material of business. The one who can retreive value from data will take big advantage in the competition. 
To bring value from data needs relevant competence, it is well known the 5-V challenges of data. 

### Data aquisition
With the boost of IoT technology, we foresee more and more data will come from sensors. The amount of data from sensors will be huge. How to aquire the data without loss, how to reduce the cost for sensor installation, how to reduce the cost of solution operation will be the key.

We have rich experience on the IoT projects and can provide our customer consulting service to achive optimal architecture for data aquisition.

### Data analytics
Data analytics is the key part of data ecosystem, which bring the value from the data. It varies from classical rule-based data analytics to machine learning to deep learning. The team use different data analytics technologies in the real industry projects, to address various challenges to help our customers to be more efficient and bring more intelligence to their business.

The team can not only help the customers develop data analytics solutions, but can also do prototype to verify hypothesis to make it quick and cheap, and also provide consulting services.

# Smart City
Urbanization is increasing world-wide and it also bring challenges:
- By 2050 cities will accommodate about 66% percent of the worldâ€™s population
- In 2012 cities occupied only about 3% of the global land area
- In 2012 cities consumed about 75% of natural resources
- In 2012 cities produced 60%-80% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

In order to address the above challenges, new and efficient ways have to be found for city operation.

In order to be more efficient to operate city, we need to rely on digital way to have better insight of infrastructure status, automate operation to replace repetitive human work, take better action based on historical data, optimize infrastructure efficiency, etc.

### Infrastructure Efficiency
We see aging infrastructures in the cities. In order to address the pressure from urbanization, there is need to extend the life cycle of infrastructure.

Energy consumption is also a big challenge for cities with increasing population, how to reduce the energy consumption is a big topic.

To maintenance the infrastructure also requires a lot of effort, we need to find a way to reduce the operational cost.

And how to improve the efficiency of infrastructures like electric grid, ports, transportation systems will be important for big cities.

Digital hub Singapore completes projects for smart lift, energy consumption dashboard, smart port. These solutions are reusable and generic.

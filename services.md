# Data Ecosystem
Data is becoming the new raw material of business. The one who can retreive value from data will take big advantage in the competition. 
To bring value from data needs relevant competence, it is well known the 5-V challenges of data. 

### Data Acquisition
With the boost of IoT technology, we foresee more and more data will come from sensors. The amount of data from sensors will be huge. How to aquire the data without loss, how to reduce the cost for sensor installation, how to reduce the cost of solution operation will be the key.

We have rich experience on the IoT projects and can provide our customer consulting service to achive optimal architecture for data aquisition.

### Data Analytics
Data analytics is the key part of data ecosystem, which bring the value from the data. It varies from classical rule-based data analytics to machine learning to deep learning. The team use different data analytics technologies in the real industry projects, to address various challenges to help our customers to be more efficient and bring more intelligence to their business.

The team can not only help the customers develop data analytics solutions, but can also do prototype to verify hypothesis to make it quick and cheap, and also provide consulting services.

### Data Platform
A platform is a plug-and-play business model that allows multiple participants (producers and consumers) to connect to it, interact with each other and create and exchange value. Veracity, DNV GL's data platform, has three main components:
- Data container is where an asset owern can securely ingest, store and share his/her data; for example streamed data from a ship, wind turbine, rig, etc.
- Marketplace holds applications, software services and data sets that can be accessed or purchased by users on the platform
- Developer’s toolbox and developer community is where data scientists, developers, programmers (in the customer DNV GL or third party organization; depending on who the asset owner chooses to share data with) can turn data into insights, value adding applications or even new business model innovations.

Veracity is both a market place and data platform that enables digital innovation and collaboration. 
Digital applications and solutions, and especially secure sharing and combination of data and insights between stakeholders, holds a great potential to unlock value for assets owners and reduce friction in the interaction between the asset owner and their stakeholders. Veracity creates an ecosystem, where value can be created between providers and consumers of data and services, and where developers and data scientists can be connected to further enrich the data.

### IoT Platform
These days many companies offer an "IoT Platform" but the term for "platform" is abused in a number of business areas. There are key commponents to be considered as an IoT platform and it should be considered when you choose the right IoT platform for your business. 

- **Connectivity** is dealing with the various kinds of network protocols of things (sensor, device, machine, asset...) and different data formats of them. IoT platform should have a connectivity module that connects both edge layer and application layer smoothly with an integrated way of communication and unified data format. 
- **Device management** is an essential component for your system keeping always up-to-date with remote software deployment and updates. It will ensure your IoT devices to be always connected and run smoothly. 
- **External interface** is supporting your business extendable. Provided APIs and SDKs will ease the interfacing with 3rd party systems such as ERP, MES and SCADA systems.

The platform technology is providing an ecosystem for both producers and consumers' values. And the platform should be designed by understanding and creating the whole business and thinking how it will create value for and build a network. 
Our team will provide the best consulting service with regard to the IoT platform technology and support you to have the right IoT platform for the business.

# Smart City
Urbanization is increasing world-wide and it also bring challenges:
- By 2050 cities will accommodate about 66% percent of the world’s population
- In 2012 cities occupied only about 3% of the global land area
- In 2012 cities consumed about 75% of natural resources
- In 2012 cities produced 60%-80% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

In order to address the above challenges, new and efficient ways have to be found for city operation.

In order to be more efficient to operate city, we need to rely on digital way to have better insight of infrastructure status, automate operation to replace repetitive human work, take better action based on historical data, optimize infrastructure efficiency, etc.

### Infrastructure Efficiency
We see aging infrastructures in the cities. In order to address the pressure from urbanization, there is need to extend the life cycle of infrastructure.

Energy consumption is also a big challenge for cities with increasing population, how to reduce the energy consumption is a big topic.

To maintenance the infrastructure also requires a lot of effort, we need to find a way to reduce the operational cost.

And how to improve the efficiency of infrastructures like electric grid, ports, transportation systems will be important for big cities.

Digital hub Singapore completes projects for smart lift, energy consumption dashboard, smart port. These solutions are reusable and generic.
